# How to reduce rape

> It is the hardest violent crime to prosecute. But most countries can do better

SEXUAL VIOLENCE is less common today than it was in earlier generations. But even in rich, peaceful democracies it is both widespread and distressingly easy to get away with. A fifth of American women will be raped at some point, by one estimate. Yet only a quarter of victims report it. Most stay silent despite the lifelong damage that rape can inflict and the desire to lock up a predator and deter others. They do so partly because the odds are stacked against them. In England and Wales in the 12 months to March 2019 only 1.5% of reported rapes ended in a criminal charge. With so little prospect of justice, many women are reluctant to undergo the ordeal of reporting an attack to the police.

Many people think women often lie about rape. They do not. The precise figure is unknowable, but the most credible estimates are that between 2% and 8% of rape allegations are false. In surveys, many police officers presume that the figure is far higher, which surely affects how they handle complaints. When a British teenager reported that she had been gang-raped in Cyprus, local police grilled her for hours, while she was traumatised, without a lawyer present. She says they pressed her into retracting her allegations, which she now insists are true. On December 30th she was convicted of lying, and faces up to a year in prison. Other women thinking of reporting rape in Cyprus may now decide not to.

Rape is an unusually difficult crime to prove, particularly when neither party denies that sex occurred (see [article](https://www.economist.com//international/2020/01/04/why-so-few-rapists-are-convicted)). A jury must be persuaded beyond reasonable doubt that the victim is telling the truth and the perpetrator is lying. Without other witnesses or physical evidence, this is hard. So long as the accused is presumed innocent until proven guilty—a cornerstone of any decent justice system—conviction rates for rape will never be as high as they are for murder.

Nonetheless, most countries could and should handle rape cases better. It starts with the law. Rape should be plainly defined as sex without consent. Several European countries and American states still require proof that force, or the threat of force, was used. This gives scant protection to victims who were unconscious, or who froze. In most of the non-Western world marital rape remains legal; it should not be. Statutes of limitations should be extended or scrapped, as they have been in Britain. Judges should let supporting witnesses attest to a pattern of predatory behaviour by the accused, as will happen at the trial of Harvey Weinstein, a film producer, which opens on January 6th.

To encourage more women to come forward, their cases should be dealt with more sensitively. In Britain nearly half of women who report rape now pull out during investigations, in part because they find the process so unpleasant. Specialised investigators should be trained in the best ways to interview traumatised complainants. In Germany, unlike Britain, all reports of rape are investigated. In Sweden such investigations are overseen by prosecutors. Evidence gathered from phones can provide valuable corroboration, but if the evidence-gathering feels like a digital strip-search, exposing the complainant’s whole life to scrutiny, it will deter many from pressing charges. More money can help, sometimes in obvious ways. Until recently some American cities had backlogs of thousands of untested “rape kits” (the DNA and other evidence collected from a victim’s body just after an alleged assault). New York City paid around $12m to clear its backlog of 17,000 untested kits amassed before 1999, helping find 2,000 matches and secure 200 arrests. Other cities have wisely followed its example.

Lastly, attitudes need to change. Sex education in Canadian, Dutch and Swedish schools includes teaching children about consent. This has been shown to reduce rape; it should be copied (see [article](https://www.economist.com//united-states/2020/01/04/austin-has-changed-sex-education-in-its-schools)). In colleges and workplaces, victims of sexual misconduct should have plenty of ways to report it, including in confidence and in escrow (so that, for example, a report is released only if more than one person makes a similar complaint about the same attacker). Rape and other forms of sexual abuse can never be eliminated. But they can be deterred more effectively than they are today. ■
