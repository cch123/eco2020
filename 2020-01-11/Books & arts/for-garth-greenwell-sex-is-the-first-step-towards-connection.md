## Love and longing

# For Garth Greenwell, sex is the first step towards connection

> His new book, “Cleanness”, takes erotic intimacy very seriously indeed

Cleanness. By Garth Greenwell. Farrar, Straus and Giroux; 240 pages; $26. To be published in Britain in April by Picador; £14.99.

WALKING IN THE boulevards of Sofia, smoking but not speaking, the young men in “Cleanness” are suffocated by their own attractions, a force that is “the opposite of air”. As they meet in cafés and pour umpteen packets of sugar into their coffee, the monolithic concrete of the Soviet-style buildings around them seems to recede; the city opens up. Their yearnings inspire both excitement and dread. They feel, but do not articulate, pain, relief and shame.

The characters in Garth Greenwell’s second work of fiction are assigned only an initial. The narrator, too, is unnamed, but—as the author himself once was, and like the narrator of his acclaimed debut “What Belongs to You” (2016)—he is an American teaching English at an elite private school in Bulgaria’s capital. This kind of “autofiction”, in which writers such as Mr Greenwell, Rachel Cusk and Karl Ove Knausgaard mine their own lives for subject matter, is currently all the rage. Sometimes the method comes across as a constricting failure of imagination; after all, the lives of many writers are too uneventful to compensate for the absence of an invented plot. And when it focuses on writers’ retreats and contemporary politics, “Cleanness” lags.

Still, at its best—and in this book’s finest passages—the genre can be searingly immediate and authentic. Mr Greenwell’s prose has a confiding timbre, alternating between prosaic and lyrical. The wind seems to whisper that “all rootedness was a sham, there were only passing arrangements, makeshift shelters and poor harbours”. Light that comes through a restaurant window is muted, “as if steeped in tea”. The author’s greatest strength, though, lies in his unblinking exploration of the chemistry of lust and mysteries of desire, both thwarted and exhausted. “Who knows why we take pleasure in such things,” the narrator reflects as he seeks out casual liaisons, often with men who are strangers; “it’s best not to look into it too closely.”

Like Sofia’s “pearly river”, a drainage ditch that is only called Perlovska on maps, erotic longing is conventionally dressed up as something else. Mr Greenwell insists that though such passions may be opaque, they should not be marginalised or denied. In his writing, he is determined to treat raw sexual instincts—“to want something and not question it”—as a major factor in human affairs, dignifying the body’s needs as the first step towards meaningful connection. To some readers, the explicit sex in his new book might seem gratuitously provocative. Yet the theme beneath the flesh is powerful and subtle: a quest for the kind of intimacy which, rather than confirming a lover’s identity, upends it.
