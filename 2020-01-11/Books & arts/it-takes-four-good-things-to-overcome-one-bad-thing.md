# It takes four good things to overcome one bad thing

> So says a provocative study of the power of negative thinking

The Power of Bad. By John Tierney and Roy F. Baumeister. Penguin Press; 336 pages; $28. Allen Lane; £20.

A POOR FIRST impression, it is widely acknowledged, counts for more than a good one. Memories that resurface suddenly tend to be unpleasant. Professional fearmongers draw a larger, more receptive audience than purveyors of restrained analysis. It is normal for people to dwell on a word of criticism for much longer than they luxuriate in a shower of praise.

For Roy Baumeister, a social psychologist, and John Tierney, a journalist, these are symptoms of “the power of bad”. Their provocative book explores what they characterise as “the universal tendency for negative events and emotions to affect us more strongly than positive ones”. Their examples make for uncomfortable reading. “One moment of parental neglect can lead to decades of angst and therapy,” they write chasteningly, “but no one spends adulthood fixated on that wonderful day at the zoo.” Other claims are dispiriting: “Successful marriages are defined not by improvement but by avoiding decline.”

Yet the authors are shrewd about the ways in which negativity can pollute both intimate relationships and large groups. They also show that bad experiences can be instructive, using stories to humanise a subject that could otherwise be dry. One concerns Felix Baumgartner (pictured), a skydiver who spent years masking his anxieties, which multiplied as he stubbornly projected an air of confidence. They only burst forth when he was in final rehearsals for an attempt to leap from a balloon 24 miles (39km) above Earth.

As they examine how Mr Baumgartner and others reverse morbid patterns of thought, the authors set out a rule of thumb: “It takes four good things to overcome one bad thing.” Accordingly, they are less keen on accentuating life’s positives than on trying to muffle its negatives. In part that means reframing adversity, like wounded soldiers who view injury “not as something that shattered their plans but as something that started them on a new path”. On a more parochial note, they advise that people who have to deal with rude customers finish every encounter, no matter how bruising, with a positive gesture—and that if you are likely to be on the receiving end of reviews, you should get a friend to summarise them, to avoid direct exposure to indelibly hurtful phrases.

A few of the authors’ tips are bland: keep to a minimum your dealings with any colleague who is clearly a bad apple, “make time for nostalgia” and in dark moments try repeating the analgesic phrase, “This too shall pass.” More often, though, their tone is challenging. They believe that higher education, after decades of enfeeblement by exaggerated anxieties about student well-being, should embrace a policy of “less carrot and more stick”. Public debate, they argue, tends to be shaped by people whose livelihood depends on amplifying the chances of catastrophe. Thus the commentariat offers rivetingly grim pieces about the risks of opioid pain-relievers, but fails to acknowledge their benefits.

At times, such judgments on supposedly overblown negativity may strike readers as a touch blasé (the authors reckon a patient’s risk of addiction to opioids is “probably less than one or two percent”). The pair are at their most bracing when, instead of lambasting the doomsayers, they extol “the upside of bad” and the power of negative experiences “to sharpen the mind and energise the will”. It has to be said, though, that some of those upsides come with titanic quantities of downside. At one point, they approvingly cite Samuel Johnson’s macabre observation that “when a man knows he is to be hanged in a fortnight, it concentrates his mind wonderfully.” ■
