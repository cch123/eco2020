# EQRX wants to make high-end medicines less costly

> A Boston-based biotech startup thinks it has found a lucrative third way between high-margin branded drugs and high-volume generics

A BIOTECH STARTUP wants to make me-too versions of existing drugs. So far, so familiar. Except that EQRx, a firm based in Boston, aims to launch ten high-end medicines, including for cancer, in ten years—quite a feat by the industry’s sluggish standards. More unusual, it wants to charge a third of the price of rival treatments, maybe less. On January 12th it announced $200m in funding from investors that included Alphabet’s venture arm and Andreessen Horowitz, a famed Silicon Valley finance firm, which gushed that EQRx promised to “reimagine how medicines are created, tested and commercialised”.

The company wants to re-engineer Big Pharma’s business model, as Amazon has done for retail or SpaceX for rocketry. It will ruthlessly outsource where necessary. More ambitiously, it wants to trim the direct costs of drug development down from the ache-inducing industry average of $375m per drug—or, some estimate, closer to $1.4bn if you count the cost of failures. Melanie Nallicheri, EQRx’s president, thinks the firm can cut failure rates from 90% to 40%. To do this, EQRx will use “precision medicine” in drugmaking. Clever software will screen molecules for their healing potential, and tests of promising compounds will be confined to patients whose variant of a disease can be pinpointed using a biological signature.

Historically, clinical trials were not too fussy about the participants they accepted. This has changed as firms try to tailor drugs to those most likely to respond to them. The new approach allows for smaller and cheaper trials, accelerating drug development. Xalkori (crizotinib), a treatment for lung cancer with particular genetic mutations, took only four years to approve.

That did not stop Pfizer, its producer, from charging a lot for it. America’s health-care system, with its layers of intermediaries, is riddled with incentives to keep prices high. Wholesalers earn a mark-up on drugs. Health insurers and employers use pharmacy-benefit managers to negotiate drug prices on their behalf. These intermediaries may obtain a rebate, and then keep some of it. As a result, branded drugs may be only slightly cheaper to the middlemen than alternatives. At the same time, even insured patients can end up having to pay a sizeable chunk of the list price.

Steve Pearson of the Institute for Clinical and Economic Review, which examines how drugs’ prices stack up against their clinical value, says the rebate system in particular has often snuffed out efforts to compete on cost. Slightly cheaper drugs known as biosimilars, popular in Europe, have made limited headway in America. EQRx will need to offer drugs at prices that are too low for the system to ignore.

The deep-pocketed venture capitalists see promise in EQRx’s third way, between expensive branded medicines and cheap generics. If this is to work, EQRx must become pretty big, pretty fast, so that higher volumes offset lower margins. Industry insiders are sceptical; developing drugs is harder than developing software, they note. Even harder, especially if the firm went public, may be resisting shareholders’ calls to charge as much for them as the distorted market will bear.■
