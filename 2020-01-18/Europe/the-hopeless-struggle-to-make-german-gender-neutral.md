## Colonic irritation

# The hopeless struggle to make German gender-neutral

> The German language is unsuited to modern sensitivities

> Jan 18th 2020BERLIN

“IN GERMAN, A young lady has no sex, while a turnip has,” grumbled Mark Twain in his essay “The Awful German Language”. The rules governing gender in German are indeed baffling: why die Rübe (feminine) but das Mädchen (neuter)? Yet they are as nothing next to the complexities of importing modern gender sensitivities into a language plainly unsuited to them.

In German, plural nouns for people typically take the masculine form, and professions are usually gendered. So teachers address mixed groups of pupils as (masculine) Schüler, and whereas Helmut Kohl was Bundeskanzler (masculine), Angela Merkel is the Bundeskanzlerin (feminine). In a non-binary age some find such usage old-fashioned. Studies find that children often link generic plural terms (eg, Schüler) with the male sex.

This month the northern city of Lübeck decreed that official communications must use gender-neutral language. Formulations that avoid gendered terms are preferred; otherwise nouns should be given the feminine ending, set off by a colon to indicate neutrality. Locals thus become Lübecker:innen (Lübeckerinnen are “women from Lübeck”; Lübecker means “men (or a man) from Lübeck”). Traditionalists are aghast; one group has vowed to pay the legal fees of municipal staff who break the new rule. But institutions across the German-speaking world are moving in this direction.

The structure of German makes it especially prone to such disputes, says Christine Günther, a linguist at the University of Siegen. English has its own problems (see Books & Arts), but nouns are genderless and job words neutral, bar the odd exception like “waitress”. In Germany, solutions usually involve awkwardly interrupting a word with an asterisk or underscore; Lübeck officials think the colon is easier to read. A glottal stop is used when speaking.

In 2018 the Council for German Orthography was asked to rule on the gender asterisk but said such matters should not be settled in a top-down fashion. Now partisans of Germany’s culture wars are storming the pitch of their defenceless language: third-gender theorists battling reactionaries over punctuation.
