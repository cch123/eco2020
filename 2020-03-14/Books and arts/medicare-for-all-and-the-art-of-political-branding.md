# “Medicare for all” and the art of political branding

> But framing policies in focus-grouped language gets politicians only so far

> Mar 12th 2020

LAST MONTH Ronnie Cowan, a Westminster MP from the Scottish National Party, wrote to Britain’s Department for Work and Pensions on behalf of some incensed pensioners in his constituency. Pensioners are often incensed, but these complaints were not about inflation-indexing or retirement ages; they were linguistic. The irate retirees did not want their pensions to be called a “benefit”.

In some other Anglophone countries, this might sound odd. What could be better than a “benefit”, which (America’s) Merriam-Webster dictionary defines as “something that produces good or helpful results or effects or that promotes well-being”? In Britain, the word means much the same in most contexts, but its other definition is more salient: as the Oxford English Dictionary has it, “That which a person is entitled to in the way of pecuniary assistance, medical or other attendance, pension, and the like, under the National Insurance Act of 1911 and similar subsequent Acts”.

This is where teachers of English might helpfully note the difference between denotation (dictionary meaning) and connotation (associations that may not be part of a formal definition). In Britain, “benefits” carry a strong connotation. For many people, a benefit is money handed out by the state, often to the undeserving. Consider “Benefits Street”, a documentary series on Channel 4 that was widely accused of portraying recipients of benefits as scroungers.

In America the equivalent term is “welfare”, which has been applied to government aid for poor families since at least the 1930s. From the 1960s and 1970s, as Republicans became the champions of small government, they began to characterise welfare-recipients as disempowered dependents on the state, or even, sometimes, as conniving parasites upon it. Campaigning for president in 1980, Ronald Reagan famously told the story of a high-living “welfare queen” from Chicago (whose exploits turned out to be somewhat exaggerated).

A lot of thought goes into the names of policies, which politicians naturally want to resonate in a positive way. Sometimes that means rebranding old ideas, or borrowing words from another domain. Democrats who say the state should pay for every American’s health care are a case in point. “Universal health care”, one way of expressing that goal, has a whiff of socialism about it. “Government-run health care” is even more off-putting, after Reagan memorably decried government as the problem rather than the solution.

Hence “Medicare for All”, touted by Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren. Medicare is the hugely popular health-care programme for retirees; Mr Sanders and Ms Warren have borrowed its sainted name to propose extending care to everyone. George Lakoff, a linguist at the University of California, Berkeley, and a left-wing activist, has been pushing Democrats to adopt more effective “frames” for their policies for years, arguing that Republicans consistently out-frame them. Mr Lakoff is a long-term advocate of “Medicare for All”. (Notably, proponents of the policy have avoided the name of Medicaid, the health-care scheme for lower-income Americans. “Medicaid” shares the taint of “welfare”; “Medicare” does not.)

But rebranding and renaming policies gets you only so far. Even upbeat words with positive associations can be tarnished and discredited. After all, “socialism” has the same root as the friendly concept of “society”. Even more starkly, “communism” is a relative of “community”, but no amount of etymology can make up for the ideology’s complicity in the deaths and immiseration of millions.

Even without such baggage, the enemy gets a vote too, as soldiers sometimes say. As soon as a shiny new idea is launched, opponents will try to associate it with everything evil under the sun. The “Green New Deal”, a set of leftish, climate-friendly proposals supported by some American Democrats, has been under relentless Republican attack since the concept was floated. Despite the bid to invoke the New Deal of the 1930s, for many voters it is now synonymous with a wild left-wing power grab.

Tainting ideas is easier than decontaminating them. And though a new slogan might help remove the stigma that has accrued, the cycle is liable to begin again, and before long yet another new label is needed. Political rebranding is sometimes necessary, but it is nowhere near sufficient. In other words, politicians can’t prevail by linguistic engineering alone. They still have to win the underlying arguments.
