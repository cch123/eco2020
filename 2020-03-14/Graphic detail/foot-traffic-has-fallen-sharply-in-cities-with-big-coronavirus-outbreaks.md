# Foot traffic has fallen sharply in cities with big coronavirus outbreaks

> Google data show Rome has been one-third less busy than usual

> Mar 14th 2020

THE PHOTOS look like stills from “28 Days Later”, a post-apocalyptic film. In St Mark’s Square in Venice, pigeons outnumber tourists. Madrid is closing prestigious art museums, including the Prado and the Reina Sofía. Beijing’s Forbidden City has been shut for weeks. Football matches are being played in front of empty stands.

The quarantines and directives to avoid travel set up in response to covid-19, a new disease, have reduced visits to tourist sites. But do these eerie images reflect a broad retreat from public spaces? Data from Google show that the virus has indeed prompted a sharp decline in overall foot traffic. They also suggest that shops and restaurants in places where covid-19 is now taking root should prepare for similar slowdowns.

By tracking mobile phones, Google constantly estimates how busy places are relative to historical averages. For example, Rome’s central train station, Termini, is typically most crowded at 9am on Fridays. Google assigns this peak level a value of 100, and expresses footfall at other times as a share of this maximum. The average value throughout the week at Termini is 30.

March 6th, however, was an unusual Friday. Even though Rome was not yet subject to an official lockdown, at 9am that day Google reported a foot-traffic level at Termini of just 31, 69 points below the average for that time. The pattern was similar at other times, and at 14 other stations and 11 museums in Rome—though the declines were steeper in tourist areas than in places frequented by locals. In total, Rome’s metro was about one-third less busy during the past week than normal, the biggest drop-off among the 18 cities we tracked. Moreover, the decline in Rome’s pedestrian traffic sharpened from 15% when the week began to around 50% when it ended.

Rome is the capital of a country with a dire outbreak, but it reflects a broad pattern. From March 3rd to 11th, footfall at metro stations was below the usual rate in 12 of the 18 cities. Among those 12, the average drop was 15%. The other cities with big dips were mainly in Asia, where covid-19 began.

In some Asian cities, the rate of new cases has fallen and normal life is resuming. Foot traffic in Hong Kong returned to standard levels on March 7th. Conversely, metro stations in New York are as busy as ever, just as the city’s outbreak gathers speed. If its counterparts elsewhere are any guide, the worst lies ahead.■
