## Genes and treatment

# Pharmacogenomics can show what your body makes of a drug

DOCTORS HAVE long appreciated that the same dose of medicine will not necessarily have the same effect on different patients. Today they are able to predict how patients will respond to hundreds of drugs. One of the ways in which people differ biologically is in how they metabolise drugs, a process largely dependent on enzymes in the liver that can vary a lot from person to person, and which are genetically determined. Differences in enzymes can lead two patients with the same disease, and the same treatment, to end up with a five-fold difference in the amount of working drug molecules in their blood.

Sometimes such differences will mean that the drug is not circulating at a high enough level to work. Sometimes it is circulating at too high a level and causing toxic side-effects. Though side-effects sound peripheral they are a huge medical problem. In Britain 6.5% of hospital admissions are related to adverse drug reactions.

The study of how genes affect an individual’s response to drugs is known as pharmacogenetics, and it is flourishing. The NHS in Britain is looking at applying pharmacogenetic tests to the treatment of 65 different medical conditions within the next few years.

One example of the technique’s potential is found with warfarin, a commonly used blood thinner that has what doctors call a “narrow therapeutic window”: the distance between a level in the blood too low to do good and a level too high for safety is small. Variations in an enzyme gene called CYP2C9, which allow warfarin to stay in the blood for longer, are quite common in white Europeans and Americans. This makes it harder to find the best therapeutic dose and increases the likelihood of adverse effects such as bleeding on the brain. Complications with warfarin cause about one-third of emergency hospital visits for older Americans.

Part of the problem with warfarin is that for a long time there was no real substitute, so it was used despite its drawbacks. The various selective serotonin-reuptake inhibitors used to treat depression offer a different challenge. Both their effectiveness and their side-effects are influenced by enzymes produced in the liver. A test produced by Myriad, a genetic-testing company, makes it possible to look at the genes for such enzymes before an antidepressant is prescribed and appears to limit side-effects and improve clinical outcomes.

In chemotherapy, too, genetics can guide the choice of treatment in ways that other indicators cannot. That matters since the drugs are so powerful. Some are so toxic that four patients in 100 will die from treatment, says David Kerr, a professor at Oxford University. Keith Gadd, an English farmer, died five weeks after a successful operation to remove a tumour from his bowel, because he was unable to metabolise the chemotherapy he had been given to lower the risk of his cancer returning.
