## Trains

# A bailout for Britain’s railways?

> Rail companies will probably end up under state control

OVERCROWDING ON trains, normally the biggest gripe of the British commuter, is no longer a problem. According to people in the industry, since the government recommended on March 16th that Britons should stay away from the office and avoid social contacts, some commuter lines have since seen their passenger numbers fall by 30%. The train operating companies are asking the government to keep them afloat. “We’re working with them all to see what it is we’d need to do to sustain them,” says Grant Shapps, the transport secretary.

Despite widespread grumbling among consumers about ticket prices, British rail firms operate on relatively thin profit margins. In 2018-19 the sector actually made a loss. With a high fixed-cost base and contractual obligations to the government to meet service requirements, even a few weeks of disruption, let alone months, would be enough to tip the entire sector much deeper into the red. FirstGroup, the only listed British operator of rail franchises, has seen its share price fall by 75% in the past month. Rail commuters tend to be better off than the average British employee, and to do jobs which offer more scope than most for working from home.

Transport for London (TFL), the public-sector body which runs London’s public transport network, said that in the week to March 15th, Tube journeys were down by 19% year on year and bus trips by 10%. If London is locked down, the Tube and the buses will presumably stop.

The industry fears that Whitehall’s bandwith is being consumed by the wider virus response and that the acute problems in the airline industry will delay government action. This week the government announced it was holding sector round tables with airlines, retailers, manufacturers and a half dozen other industries. Rail was notable for its absence. Yet while the civil service may not have the resources to consider a new package for rail, there may be one almost ready to go. The long-awaited, but much-delayed, Williams Review of the structure of the rail industry was expected to report this month, although that is now likely to be put off further.

Keith Williams, the former airline-industry boss heading the review, had been expected to recommend a move from the current franchise model to a concession system. Under that framework, common in other rich countries, private companies manage the trains, but the model is different from the one operating in Britain. Rather than carrying the costs and reaping the rewards, rail companies get a fee from the state for the service they provide. The government gets the income from fares, and taxpayers bear the risk in case of losses. That’s how London Overground, a well-run network, operates.

Train operators have been somewhat wary of a concession model, preferring the potential financial upside of the current franchise arrangements. But with losses mounting, the sector is now keen for the government to take back control. A once controversial package of reforms has suddenly found unlikely friends.■
