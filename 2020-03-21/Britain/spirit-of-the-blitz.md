WHEN THE British are confronted with a national crisis they default to talking about the second world war—and especially 1940, when Britain stood alone against Hitler’s Germany. Boris Johnson, who fancies himself as Churchill, has declared that “we must act as in wartime and do everything it takes to support the economy”. Matt Hancock, the health secretary, has called on Britons to emulate their grandparents’ behaviour during the Blitz. “Despite the pounding every night, the rationing, the loss of life, they pulled together in one gigantic national effort. Today our generation is facing its own test, fighting a very real and new disease.”

Some smart people think that this is all juvenile jingoism. What is the point of comparing a virus with a political movement? Why bring up Germany’s dark past when today it is fighting the same enemy as Britain? In 1940 the English Channel helped to keep the foe at bay. Today it is among us and spreading rapidly. When T.S. Eliot proclaimed in “Little Gidding”, written while he was fire-watching during the Blitz, that “history is now and England” he captured Britain’s unique role in holding the line against Nazism. The appropriate line today would be “history is now and everywhere”.

Helen Lewis, of the Atlantic magazine, argues that the Blitz spirit may actually be harmful because it encourages older people—people incidentally who are most at risk from the virus—to ignore namby-pamby advice about the need for washing your hands and staying at home. “This appeal to Blitz spirit, to the unbowed might of Albion, to the idea that Britain withstood the Luftwaffe”, she writes, “all of it is deeply unhelpful when dealing with an infectious disease.”

Dunderheads can always draw daft conclusions from the historical record—and concluding that there’s something Churchillian about not washing your hands is daft indeed. But the comparison to wartime is nevertheless compelling. Covid-19 marks a sharp break in history just as Hitler’s Blitzkrieg did. Dealing with the virus will call for dramatic action of a kind that has seldom been seen in peacetime.

Britain already has a wartime feel. People listen to prime-ministerial announcements and BBC news bulletins with the same anxious seriousness that they did back in 1940. Great commuter terminals are empty. Freedom of movement is being curtailed. People are hunkering down in their homes. Urged on by the government, manufacturers, including Vauxhall and Airbus, are repurposing their factories to make ventilators.

Even in normal times the British are unusually fond of celebrating their history. Turn on the television on a Sunday night and there is a historical drama on offer. The most successful highbrow novel of the past few years is Hilary Mantel’s three-volume roman á Cromwell. Whereas some countries are defined by their creeds (liberté, egalité, fraternité  in France, the American dream in America) Britain is defined by its long history. Whereas most countries have felt the need to exorcise parts of their past out of shame or rage, Britain has never been subjected to the rule of Nazis, Communists or other madmen. In abnormal times the British instinctively turn to history for both inspiration and a roadmap.

And what year in history could be more inspiring and instructive than 1940? The world’s future hung by a thread. If the RAF had lost control of the air, Britain would have fallen to the Germans and America would have stayed out of the war. The British summoned up extraordinary heroism to keep that thread from snapping. It also contains important lessons for today: that you can change the course of history through force of will; that Britain’s greatest resource is the character of ordinary people rather than the genius of elites; and that character is reflected in the way you go about your daily business—keeping calm and carrying on; resisting the temptation to hoard or shirk—as well as in war heroics. Churchill might have provided the roar, as he put it, but it was the people who had the lion’s heart.

During the civil war over Brexit—remember that?—the Brexiteers made a concerted attempt to expropriate the memory of the Blitz and yoke it to a partisan cause. The white cliffs of Dover, films such as “The Dam Busters”, David Low’s celebrated cartoon, captioned “very well, alone”, depicting a Tommy, fist in the air, defying the storm-tossed seas and German bombers. All were part of the Brexiteer lexicon. Boris Johnson even warned that dreams of European unification had always ended in disaster: “Napoleon, Hitler, various people tried this out, and it ends tragically.” Today some curmudgeons argue that younger people are too enfeebled by the cult of victimhood to play their part.

Covid-19 provides Britain with an opportunity to recapture the memory of the Blitz for the whole nation rather than for a political sect. It also provides the young with a chance to prove the curmudgeons wrong. Though hoarding is all too common, it is more than offset by acts of public-spiritedness. Post Office workers have offered to turn themselves into an additional emergency service delivering food parcels and pharmaceuticals and checking on the vulnerable. Neighbourhood groups are spontaneously organising online; much more help is being offered than there is need for it, as yet. Many people report getting in touch with, and hearing from, friends and relations they haven’t spoken to for years.

Back in 1940 the British showed an acute sense of the power of history to inspire a beleaguered people. The Picture Post said in 1940 “some nations are separated by a sad gulf from a heroic past but we are not”. The Times likened the struggle for control of the Channel ports to epics of English history such as Agincourt, the Armada and Waterloo. On June 18th Churchill urged the British to “so bear ourselves that if the British empire and its commonwealth last for a thousand years men will say, ‘This was their finest hour’.” Winning the war against covid-19 will require the world to mobilise all its resources. One of the most powerful resources that Britain has is its memory.■
