The supreme leader of Iran, which is fighting one of the world’s worst outbreaks of covid-19, rejected an offer of aid from America. “Possibly your medicine is a way to spread the virus more,” said Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, revealing an odd worldview. China’s ambassador to America said it was “harmful” to speculate about the origin of covid-19. His remarks appeared aimed at a baseless conspiracy theory, promoted by some Chinese diplomats, that the American army may have brought the virus to China.See [article](https://www.economist.com//leaders/2020/03/26/iran-cannot-fight-covid-19-with-conspiracy-theories).
