The S&P 500 fell by 20% over the three months; the Dow Jones Industrial Average was down by 23%. London’s FTSE 100 dropped by 25%, its worst quarter since 1987. Commodity prices also slumped. The price of Brent crude oil plunged by 55% in March, but rose this week amid hopes that Saudi Arabia and Russia might end their price war.

The European Central Bank told banks in the euro zone to suspend dividend payments so that they can increase their lending capacity.

With investors flocking to the haven of the dollar, the Federal Reserve created a new facility to help many foreign central banks access the greenback and stabilise the market.

China’s official manufacturing index rose sharply in March, bouncing back from a record low in February.

Australia tightened its rules on foreign takeovers amid concern that businesses struggling because of covid-19 restrictions, particularly in the airline industry, could be snapped up cheaply.

More American retailers who have had to close their stores during the coronavirus outbreak forced their shop workers to take a leave of absence.

OneWeb, a startup seeking to provide cheap internet connectivity through a network of satellites, filed for bankruptcy protection pending a sale of the business. It blamed covid-19, having reportedly failed to secure a loan from SoftBank, one of its investors.
