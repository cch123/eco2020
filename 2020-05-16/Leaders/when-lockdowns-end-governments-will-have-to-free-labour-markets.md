NEVER BEFORE have governments erected safety-nets as generous as those they have created during the pandemic. In Britain 7.5m furloughed workers’ wages are being paid in large part by the state, which is spending more on them than it is on health care. In France the government is topping up the majority of private-sector workers’ incomes after their hours were cut. America has increased unemployment benefits by $600 per person per week, almost trebling the average payout. Since March a staggering 34m or so claims for this kind of support have been made (see [article](https://www.economist.com//united-states/2020/05/16/inefficiencies-bedevil-americas-response-to-soaring-joblessness)). Germany and Japan have boosted their existing subsidy schemes for furloughed or partially furloughed workers.

These policies have been indispensable. Replacing lost incomes has averted suffering, prevented economies from falling apart and ensured public support for social-distancing measures. Yet governments need to prepare an exit strategy not just from lockdowns, but also from their emergency policies (see [article](https://www.economist.com//europe/2020/05/14/france-is-leaving-lockdown-now-the-trouble-begins)). They cannot replace private incomes indefinitely. If today’s transfers are maintained for too long, they will be ruinously expensive and prevent labour markets from adapting to the new way of life that emerges from the pandemic.

Many of today’s schemes reflect the idea that economies need to be placed in deep freeze in order to be revived intact once the crisis subsides. Yet it seems increasingly likely that economies will instead be permanently changed. Consumers may emerge from lockdown with new habits and fears about mixing, spending less on restaurants, cinemas and travel, and spending more on deliveries, home-improvement and video-streaming. Employees may, reasonably, demand higher wages to perform some jobs, such as construction or butchering, which involve working elbow-to-elbow with others all day. And industries starved of immigrant labour because of border controls may have to entice in more locals. Four in ten American jobs lost in the pandemic will not return, according to one estimate based on surveys, historical patterns and stockmarket signals. Three in ten gross job losses have already been offset by new hiring.

The necessary adjustments will not take place while the state pays workers to wait for their old jobs to return—often on better money than they got before. In America roughly three-quarters of recipients of unemployment insurance are receiving more than they did in work. That blunts the incentive to seek new jobs. And yet cutting support abruptly would leave legions of unemployed workers fending for themselves in brutal conditions, especially in America with its thin welfare system.

Governments thus face a difficult balancing act: withdraw support too readily, and many people will suffer; withdraw it too late, and the economy will ossify. To find the right path, the most lavish support should be maintained only in industries which the government is forcibly keeping closed. Once shops, restaurants and cinemas are allowed to open, the market must decide if they have a future. These signals should not be ignored for long.

Schemes should also encourage flexibility. Idled workers should be allowed to return to their companies part-time, as Britain this week pledged. America should make more use of work-sharing schemes, already in place in about half of the states, which, as in Europe, provide benefits on the basis of lost hours of work, not just lost jobs. This should be paired with unemployment insurance, though neither scheme should pay so much that it discourages seeking full-time work.

Finally, governments should help people find new jobs. That means boosting support for training, tearing down barriers to opportunity such as unnecessary licensing rules, and cutting payroll taxes to encourage hiring. As in normal times, governments must not stand in the way of economic change. They should instead grease its wheels—while offering a helping hand to those who are left behind. ■
