STIMULUS CHEQUES arrived in April, but lockdowns gave Americans little chance to splurge. Instead they squirrelled away a third of their incomes—their highest saving rate ever.

The extent to which activity rebounds as lockdowns end will depend on whether consumers stay cautious, perhaps because of an uncertain jobs market, or whether they splash the cash.
