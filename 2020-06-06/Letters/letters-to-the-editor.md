You rightly say that governments’ pandemic debts will need to be paid for, and mention taxes on land, inheritance and carbon emissions as options (“[After the disease, the debt](https://www.economist.com//leaders/2020/04/23/after-the-disease-the-debt)”, April 25th). Why not add a tax on leverage to your list? After all, one reason governments will need to borrow so much is because they are bailing out over-indebted companies. Astonishingly, the credit crunch did nothing to curtail firms’ borrowings. Non- financial corporations around the world increased their debt by 70%, to $74trn, in the 12 years to 2019, according to the Institute of International Finance. What’s more, countries actually encourage their companies to splurge on debt by making interest payments tax deductible, whereas it would be far better for society if they had more equity.

Governments should phase out the tax-deductibility of interest payments once the pandemic is over. This would kill two birds with one stone. Governments would claw back some of the bail-out costs; and firms would have an incentive to build fatter equity buffers, and be in better shape when the next crisis hits.

Accelerating budget deficits and government debt caused havoc in the past. However, in modern times, quantitative easing, low inflation and negative interest rates have shown that we can create and live with much more debt than we envisaged. This is not possible in countries like Argentina and Zimbabwe with stress on their currencies, but it is possible in the big currency blocs. America, China, Europe and Japan control most of the world’s money supply. When they simultaneously decide to accelerate their spending with trillions to fight the corona crisis, and together expand their budget deficits and public debt through QE with the same speed, then the relative position of their currencies does not change much.

Over time the trade- and public-debt positions of these four blocs will be in balance with each other, but on a much higher level. They will thereby retain the value of their currencies in relation to each other. If we agree that public debt can be rolled over indefinitely, then the only limitation to higher public-debt levels should be the ability to pay the interest. And at interest-rate levels of 1% or lower, there is ample room for public-debt growth without disrupting the value of the four currencies, in relation to each other.

Now is the time for innovation. For example, rather than raise wages for health workers the government could borrow at less than 1% to buy residential housing and rent it to those staff at a subsided rate. We need a new psychology of taxation. In Britain, for example, people have voluntarily donated millions of pounds to support the National Health Service. Yet tax is still seen by many as something to avoid more vehemently than covid-19 itself.

Regarding your article about government advice in Indonesia on sunbathing (“[Hot spot](https://www.economist.com//asia/2020/05/09/sun-shy-indonesians-are-suddenly-soaking-up-the-rays)”, May 9th), it is now well established that acute respiratory-tract infections are often related to Vitamin D deficiency. There is some evidence to suggest that those dying from covid-19 are more often deficient in Vitamin D than might be expected. Vitamin D is different from most other vitamins, in that it is hard to obtain in sufficient amounts just through a good diet. The only effective normal way to obtain it is through regular exposure to the sun, something that is not popular in Indonesia and in many other hot countries.

Such is the growing deficiency of Vitamin D that supplementing Vitamin D3 intake is now highly recommended, especially for those not getting sufficient sunlight on their skin. A meta-analysis using many studies and a review published in the British Medical Journal in 2017 by doctors from around the world showed with convincing evidence that regular supplementation offered protection against respiratory-tract infections. Despite all of this medical corroboration demonstrating an important relationship between vitamin D deficiency and lack of sun exposure with increased respiratory deaths, the issue is often overlooked.

The solution to the BBC’s funding problems (“[The next episode](https://www.economist.com//britain/2020/04/25/the-bbc-is-having-a-good-pandemic)”, April 25th) is to package its incredible catalogue of programmes under the BBC brand, rather than bundle them through BritBox, and offer subscriptions free to those who already pay their licence fee. That would appeal to younger audiences who want to watch, for example, old episodes of “Doctor Who”. The BBC doesn’t fail to attract younger audiences because of its content. Rather, younger viewers are put off by its archaic format. Why be stuck in front of a TV set for hours when you can binge watch your favourite series whenever you want online?

The BBC is good at two things: news coverage and documentaries. I would challenge anyone who thinks it is still the world leader in period dramas to note the global popularity of Netflix’s “The Crown”. Regarding the BBC’s wider product, I have yet to meet someone who believes that their licence fee was well spent on creating no fewer than nine seasons of “Two Pints of Lager and a Packet of Crisps”.

It probably is not “an accident of history” that clock hands rotate in the direction they do (“[Shear, veer, cheer](https://www.economist.com//science-and-technology/2020/05/14/which-way-a-wind-turbine-turns-might-not-seem-to-matter)”, May 16th). Clockmakers simply stuck with what was familiar; the direction at which the shadow of the gnomon on a sundial moves in the northern hemisphere. Had a civilisation in the southern hemisphere invented clocks with dials, their hands would have moved in the other direction.

Following the letter ([May 23rd](https://www.economist.com//letters/2020/05/23/letters-to-the-editor)) from a reader wondering why The Economist always lists solutions in sets of three, a wise colleague once told me:

One point? Don’t be political. It is never about just one thing.

Two points? You’ve not thought enough about the problem. Do more research.

Four points or more? Summarise and cut the waffle.

Yup, three points in a list is just about right.

JONATHAN LUNTHaywards Heath, West Sussex

Many cultures prefer certain number patterns. The Economist merely reflects the Indo-European preference for the number three. Look at American institutions; CIA, FBI, NBC and so on. See the “Handbook of Classical Mythology” by William Hansen.

First globalisation, then slowbalisation, and now…nobalisation? (“[Goodbye globalisation](https://www.economist.com//leaders/2020/05/14/has-covid-19-killed-globalisation)”, May 16th.)
