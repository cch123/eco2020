# Politics this week

> Jun 6th 2020

Both riots and peaceful protests spread across America in response to the death of George Floyd. It was the country’s worst unrest for decades, prompting many states to call out the National Guard and cities to impose curfews. Looting accompanied the chaos; shops in midtown Manhattan were ransacked. The policeman who knelt on Mr Floyd’s neck for nine minutes was indicted for second-degree murder; the three officers who failed to stop him were charged with lesser offences. Donald Trump suggested sending in the army to restore order. Mark Esper, the defence secretary, said soldiers should only be deployed as a last resort.

In response to China’s move to impose a new national-security bill on Hong Kong, Donald Trump said his administration would “begin the process” of scrapping the “full range” of policies that treat the territory differently from the rest of China. He also said he was “terminating” America’s relationship with the WHO, citing China’s “total control” over the body, and banned Chinese airlines from flying to the United States from June 16th, a tit-for-tat measure. China’s aviation regulator indicated that it would allow limited flights to resume.

Britain’s prime minister, Boris Johnson, suggested that if China enacts the national-security law in Hong Kong, Britain could make it easier for up to 3m Hong Kongers to go to Britain to live and work and eventually become citizens.
