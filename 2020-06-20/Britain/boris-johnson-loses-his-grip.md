# Boris Johnson loses his grip

> The prime minister’s poor management of the covid crisis is undermining his ability to govern

> Jun 20th 2020

BRITAIN’S CHAOTIC departure from the European Exchange Rate Mechanism on “Black Wednesday” in 1992 destroyed John Major’s premiership and condemned the country to five years of agony, as the Tory government stumbled from crisis to crisis. The coronavirus debacle now threatens to do the same to Boris Johnson. He has a bigger majority than Sir John (87 compared with 23) and is more loved by Tories. But the corona crisis is much bigger than the ERM episode and will be harder to escape from.

Mr Johnson’s poor handling of the crisis has wrecked the government’s most important asset, its sense of authority. The government may already have lost the public: ratings for “being in charge of the situation” have been negative since May. It is beginning to lose its own party, too. Tory MPs have a litany of complaints about government policies. They especially dislike the insistence that strangers must stay two metres apart when other countries have settled on 1.5 metres or less, the back-tracking over reopening schools, the decision to quarantine those arriving from abroad for a fortnight, the abolition of virtual voting, which forces MPs to stand in a mile-long “conga line” to cast their votes, and the unruly streets, with up to 40 police officers injured in a fortnight of protests and counter-protests. Habitual critics of Mr Johnson ask: what did you expect? Others are “worse than despondent”, says one. “Despondent implies that you think that there might be a way out.”

Mr Johnson’s authority, like that of the Roman emperors he studied at university, rested on fear and charisma. He struck fear into his colleagues by repeated shows of brutality, expelling half the Cabinet when he took over as prime minister, purging 21 MPs who voted against the party and dispatching his chancellor, Sajid Javid. He also used his considerable political charisma to help win an audacious general election in December. Dominic Cummings, Mr Johnson’s key adviser, was central to this regime of fear and charisma, picking fights with all and sundry but also earning a reputation as a campaigning genius.

But fear and charisma only work so long as they are accompanied by competence. The backbenchers who once feared Mr Johnson and Mr Cummings are now more worried about the fury of their own constituents. There is talk of emperors without clothes and wizards behind the curtain. The ministers Mr Johnson demoted in his early months may now have a chance for revenge.

Downing Street has woken up to the fact that it has a party-management problem on its hands and is making an effort to hold more meetings with backbenchers and ministerial assistants. The “town hall” faction in Downing Street—people who worked with Mr Johnson when he was mayor of London, led by Sir Eddie Lister—are much more emollient than Mr Cummings. The whips should regain some power when they can do their arm-twisting in person rather than over Zoom. The leadership can also take some comfort from the fact that, despite much bad news, the nine polls taken since June 1st show the Tories leading Labour by between two and eight points.

But righting the ship will be difficult. The public’s growing distrust of the powers-that-be has been exacerbated by the progression from simple messages (“don’t go out”) to more nuanced ones (“be aware”), and there are plenty of timber-shaking covid storms on the horizon. Unemployment could surge to over 3m when the furlough scheme winds down. Britain’s poor performance is becoming painfully obvious as locked-down Britons watch images of continentals relaxing in cafés and returning to work.

More and more people worry that Mr Johnson was brought in to solve one problem—getting Brexit done—but is now confronted with an entirely different one. A Cabinet that was selected on the basis of ideological soundness rather than competence seems overwhelmed by events. Two figures, Gavin Williamson, the education secretary who has blown hot and cold over whether children can go back to school, and Robert Jenrick, the local-government minister, who is entangled in a scandal with an insalubrious party donor, look particularly dismal. Mr Cummings’s formidable skills in running campaigns have not translated to governing the country. You can’t gaslight a pandemic.

The new intake of Tory MPs is proving to be surprisingly hard to manage. A veteran observer of the party says that he expected rebellions from Europhile MPs and ageing Brexiteers who have been muscled aside by Mr Cummings. But what has surprised him is the rebelliousness of Tories from the largely working-class “red seats” who were carried to the House of Commons on Mr Johnson’s coat-tails. These neophytes have not been inculcated with loyalty to the party by several failed runs for seats; some are local figures who do not have an eye on national office. They are unlikely to become more obedient as the unemployment numbers mount.

All this points to a future in which the Conservative Party stumbles from crisis to crisis. Tory rebellions will become part of the political landscape, just as they were under Theresa May. Climb-downs and U-turns will become routine. On June 16th the government reversed its opposition to providing poor children with free school meal vouchers over the summer in the face of a campaign mounted by Marcus Rashford, a 22-year-old footballer. With the exception of Brexit, on which it is likely to remain adamantine, Downing Street may even reverse itself on some big questions. Mr Johnson’s support for Huawei is beginning to soften under pressure from the newly formed China Research Group.

For a while it looked as if the new government had put an end to the era of political chaos that began four years ago with the referendum and consumed Theresa May’s premiership. Now, thanks to a pandemic that not even the most Eurosceptic MP can blame on the EU, another era of chaos has been unleashed and another Tory prime minister is condemned to years of agony.
