# Munira Mirza, revolutionary conservative

> She is unlikely to calm the tensions around Black Lives Matter

> Jun 25th 2020

DURING A RECENT Black Lives Matter protest in Hyde Park, one of the organisers, Imarn Ayton, led the crowd in chanting “Munira Mirza must go”. “She does not believe in what we believe in,” proclaimed Ms Ayton. “New narrative today!” As director of Number 10’s in-house think-tank, the Policy Unit, the unbeliever in question has hitherto been an obscure figure in Boris Johnson’s high command, albeit an important one. She has been content to let Dominic Cummings soak up the media’s attention while building up the most impressive Conservative policy team since Margaret Thatcher’s day. But Boris Johnson’s decision to give her the job of establishing a new government commission on racial inequalities immediately transformed her into a lightning rod.

Ms Mirza is an unlikely Tory. Her parents—a factory worker and a part-time Urdu teacher—migrated from Pakistan to Oldham, a northern working-class town. She went to an overwhelmingly Asian comprehensive school and was the only pupil from her sixth-form college to go to Oxford University, where she got a first in English. She joined the Revolutionary Communist Party (RCP), a Trotskyite groupuscule that regarded the Communist Party of Great Britain as a bunch of sell-outs. She spent her spare time reading not just Lenin and Trotsky but also Antonio Gramsci, who believed that revolutionaries need to take over “the culture” as well as the formal institutions of power. She moved to Kent University to study sociology with Frank Furedi, leading light of the RCP, and wrote for the party’s in-house journal, Living Marxism.

And yet today Ms Mirza is so close to Boris Johnson that he says she is one of the five women he most admires, along with Boudicca and his grandmother. She spent eight years working as his deputy mayor for culture when he was mayor of London, and defended him vigorously when he likened women wearing burqas to “bank robbers” and “letter boxes”, her ethnicity giving him useful cover. Mr Johnson likes to refer to her as his “nonsense detector”.

Ms Mirza’s rightward journey began after the RCP underwent an institutional and ideological meltdown in 2000 when Living Marxism was bankrupted in a libel trial. She was not the only party member to loosen her ideological moorings: Claire Fox established the Institute of Ideas and eventually became an MEP for the Brexit Party, while Ms Mirza became chief fundraiser for a new centre-right think-tank, Policy Exchange (PX).

Ms Mirza says that the question of intellectual freedom was at the heart of her conversion to the right: “I realised very quickly that the main thing that the left was not in favour of was free speech—that there was an intolerance about different ideas and opinions.” Equally important is the idea that individuals are masters of their own fate. The left is increasingly preoccupied by the idea that people’s identity is fixed by the groups into which they are born, a notion which Ms Mirza’s trajectory challenges. But though her political journey is a long one, she has not left all of her past behind. The RCP and Mr Johnson’s Conservative Party have more in common than might at first appear.

Ms Mirza’s arrival at PX coincided with two changes in the Conservative Party that turned her into a hot property. The first was the party’s growing interest in “the culture”. In the 1990s, the party was dominated by efficiency experts who wanted to apply cost-benefit analysis to everything and traditionalists who shared Sir John Major’s enthusiasm for “old maids cycling to Holy Communion through the morning mist”. PX decided that Conservatives needed to embrace Britain’s more diverse culture (one of the PX’s founders, Nick Boles, is gay) while pushing back against the left-wing idea that all minorities are victims. The second was the party’s growing appetite for revolution: the belief that the only way to protect the ancien régime from internal collapse is to purify it, often by borrowing the tools of revolutionaries. Michael Gove, one of PX’s other founders, liked to display posters of Lenin and Malcolm X on his office wall and to praise Mao Zedong’s Long March. He also acted as a long-term patron of Dominic Cummings, a man who can’t see an institution without giving it a good kicking.

The party’s cultural agenda and revolutionary turn are linked. Today’s radical Tories believe that the left’s grip on what Gramsci called the “instruments of cultural reproduction” is so tight that conservative values can be promoted only by revolutionary means. What’s the point of reforming the civil service if civil servants have no national pride? Or in reorganising education if professors and teachers tell pupils that they are victims of structural oppression? You need to apply electric-shock treatment to the prevailing mindset. Hence Mr Cummings’ war on “the blob”, formerly known as the establishment—the people at the centre of the country’s political and intellectual life who these days share a liberal internationalist world view. And hence the Brexiteers’ demand for a radical rupture from the European Union.

Ms Mirza is in the vanguard of this revolution. She rejects beliefs widely accepted in “the blob”. Her first publication for PX, “Culture Vultures”, argued that cultural institutions are short-changing working-class pupils by emphasising “relevance” rather than high culture. Her second, “Living Apart Together”, argued that multiculturalism fostered Islamist extremism by encouraging Muslims to see themselves as a separate group, and she rejects the idea that British society is structurally racist.

Ms Mirza brings a sharp and well-informed voice to an important area. But she also has a dangerous appetite for iconoclasm and polarising rhetoric, and her passionate individualism offers few policy solutions to the problems of racism and limited opportunities available to black people.

Britain’s debate about race is calmer than America’s. Politicians as different as Theresa May, a former prime minister, and David Lammy, an eloquent black Labour MP, agree on important points. Ms Mirza needs to temper her combative instincts with pragmatism, or risk turning it into another front in the culture war. ■
