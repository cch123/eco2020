# The government takes on the civil service

> Boris v the bureaucrats

> Jul 2nd 2020

THE CEASEFIRE is over. A couple of months ago the government suspended its war on the establishment “blob” to focus on covid-19 but, although the epidemic continues to rage, it has taken up arms again. Dominic Cummings, Boris Johnson’s chief adviser, has declared that “a hard rain” is going to fall on the civil service and Mr Johnson has blasted his biggest target to date. In effect he sacked Sir Mark Sedwill, who combined the job of the head of the civil service with that of national security adviser, the day after Michael Gove, the minister for the Cabinet Office, laid out a blueprint for reforming Whitehall in a lecture to the great and the good.

The government’s critics complain that this is a cynical ploy to shift the blame for Britain’s dismal handling of the epidemic from politicians to civil servants. The government argues that rebuilding post-covid Britain requires a better bureaucracy. Whichever of these clashing positions is closer to the truth—and there is probably something in both—the fight to refashion the civil service will be at the heart of politics for the rest of Mr Johnson’s premiership.

The lecture contained lots of typically Govian fireworks—a quotation from Gramsci (“The inherited is dying—and the new cannot be born”), W.H. Auden’s description of the 1930s (“a low dishonest decade”). But it also contained a blueprint for reform. Mr Gove wants to reconnect the civil service with the country that it serves. That means moving “decision-making centres” out of London and broadening recruitment. He also wants to bring it into line with the modern economy. The traditional “Rolls-Royce” civil service was built on the idea of recruiting people with fine minds who moved between departments as they ascended towards knighthoods and gold-plated pensions. But Rolls-Royces are costly and inefficient. Mr Gove wants more specialists who can develop deep expertise, more mathematicians who understand “the Monte Carlo method or Bayesian statistics”, and more evidence-based policy rather than shots in the dark.

Mr Gove is right that the state’s administrative brain should not be trapped in the capital city, stuck in the past, or short of expertise. The more distinct London becomes from the rest of Britain, the stronger the case for moving some departments to the regions. And the more the world is driven by tech the stronger the case for recruiting more people who understand the digital world.

Yet Mr Gove displays considerable chutzpah in casting himself as the champion of expertise. He is an English-literature graduate who made his career as a newspaper columnist—an instant expert on everything, in other words—and the problems he described are far more prevalent in Mr Johnson’s government than in the civil service. Deep expertise? Whatever the merits of having the same man running both the civil service and the National Security Council, Sir Mark brought to the latter job decades of experience in the national-security world. His replacement, David Frost, is a political appointee whose CV includes a degree in medieval history and a spell as head of the Scotch Whisky Association.

And for all the Cummings-inspired rhetoric, these complaints are very familiar. Mr Gove echoed a century’s worth of civil-service reformers who have railed against Whitehall’s faults. Lloyd George established Mr Gove’s department, the Cabinet Office, to bring in outsiders with “push and go”. In 1968 the Fulton Report argued for replacing generalists with specialists and time-serving with rapid promotion. Margaret Thatcher brought in Derek Rayner, the boss of Marks & Spencer, to make Whitehall more businesslike. Governments have been moving civil servants out of London for decades. Why should it be any different this time?

The answer lies in the combination of Brexit and covid-19. Leaving the European Union has thrown many of the pieces of government in the air, providing the opportunity to reconfigure them. Covid-19 has shown the British state in a dismal light. The epidemic took a bigger toll in Britain than in other European countries not just because politicians made bad decisions, but also because bits of the machinery of government failed. There is now a cross-party consensus that a rethink is needed. On May 19th Gus O’Donnell, head of the civil service from 2005 to 2011, a trustee of The Economist and in many ways the embodiment of the blob that Mr Cummings demonises, told the Institute for Government that Britain needs to improve “state capacity” and “state resilience” to deal with unexpected threats.

Not all attempts to bring about change have been stillborn. When Paul Samuelson, a great American economist, visited the Treasury in 1961, he was shocked to find how few economists it employed. Today you can’t throw a stone there without hitting one: Lord O’Donnell, who ran the Treasury before moving to the Cabinet Office, was a specialist in econometrics who taught at Glasgow University. The Government Economic Service, founded in 1964, now has 1,400 economists—more than in any other institution in the country. The state’s performance on covid-19 has been patchy rather than uniformly dismal: the Treasury produced a world-class rescue package in as little as a week.

The biggest obstacle to reforming the state is not the establishment’s resistance to reform but the government itself. Mr Johnson instinctively values loyalty, to both himself and Brexit, above competence, particularly if the loyalty comes from Brexiteers. His predecessor, Theresa May, voiced many people’s worries when she asked, regarding Mr Frost’s appointment, “Why…is the new national security adviser a political appointee with no proven expertise in national security?” Mr Johnson is also surrounded by people—particularly Mr Cummings—who think that the only way to achieve change is to wage war. This is as counterproductive as it is thuggish. It turns potential allies into enemies and green shoots into scorched earth.

This government has a better chance of building a more effective British state than any government in decades. If it fails, it will have only itself to blame.■
