# Mississippi changes its state flag

> And removes a Confederate symbol

> Jul 4th 2020

THE MAGNOLIA STATE this week became the last southern state to change its state flag, removing the Confederate battle flag which had formed part of the design. It will adopt a new flag, incorporating the words “In God We Trust” but excluding the so-called “stainless banner”. The 87-year-old widow of Medgar Evers, a murdered civil-rights icon, called the vote “all but unbelievable to me”.
