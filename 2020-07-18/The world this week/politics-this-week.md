Donald Trump signed an executive order ending Hong Kong’s privileged trading status with America, in response to China’s imposition of a crushing national-security law. Under new legislation, banks aiding officials who implement the law may face sanctions, as may the officials. See [article](https://www.economist.com//china/2020/07/18/why-business-in-hong-kong-should-be-worried).

Separately, China announced sanctions against American officials, including Marco Rubio and Ted Cruz, two Republican senators. The move was in retaliation against American penalties on Chinese politicians for abusing the human rights of China’s Uighur citizens.

Jeff Sessions was clobbered in Alabama’s Republican Senate primary by Tommy Tuberville. Mr Sessions, a senator for 20 years until 2017, was an early supporter of Donald Trump, who made him attorney-general. His decision to recuse himself from investigations into Russian interference in the 2016 election made the president turn on him.

Martín Vizcarra, Peru’s president, replaced more than half of his cabinet after his approval ratings fell. Pedro Cateriano, a previous prime minister, has taken the job again. The recession caused by the pandemic has led Mr Vizcarra’s popularity to drop from 87% in March to a still-impressive 65%.

The ruling People’s Action Party (PAP) won Singapore’s general election, as it has every election since independence in 1965. The opposition won ten out of 93 seats—its best showing ever.

Libya’s eastern-based parliament said it would “welcome” Egyptian military intervention in the country’s civil war to counter Turkish support for the internationally recognised Government of National Accord (GNA), based in Tripoli.
