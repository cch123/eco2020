A state of emergency was declared in Lebanon, after a huge explosion at Beirut’s port. The blast was felt in Cyprus, 240km away. It killed at least 135 people, injured 5,000 and left 300,000 homeless. The cause was a fire in a warehouse holding 2,750 tonnes of ammonium nitrate, a chemical used in fertiliser and bombs. This highly explosive stockpile had lain neglected for six years. Lebanon’s prime minister, Hassan Diab, vowed that those responsible would “pay the price”. Lebanon was in an economic and political crisis even before the blast. See [article](https://www.economist.com//leaders/2020/08/08/a-big-blast-should-lead-to-big-change-in-lebanon).

A report by the BBC Persian service accused Iran of covering up deaths from covid-19. Leaked official data showed the number of Iranians who have died with covid-19 symptoms to be nearly three times higher than the government admits. Known infections were almost double the public figures.

Colombia’s Supreme Court ordered that Álvaro Uribe, a conservative former president, be placed under house arrest.

Five months after the vote, a final result was declared in Guyana’s presidential election, allowing Irfaan Ali, of the mainly Indo-Guyanese People’s Progressive Party, to be sworn into office.

Narendra Modi, India’s prime minister, laid the foundation stone of a temple to the Hindu god Ram in the city of Ayodhya. The temple is being built on the site of a mosque that was torn down by an organised Hindu mob in 1992, sparking riots in which 2,000 people died. Its construction has been a goal of Mr Modi’s Bharatiya Janata Party since the 1980s.

Black Lives Matter activists scored their biggest upset in the Democratic primaries so far when Cori Bush defeated William Lacy Clay, the incumbent congressman in St Louis. Mr Clay, who is black, has served the district since 2001; his father held the seat before that for 32 years.

The former king of Spain, Juan Carlos, went into voluntary exile, two months after Spain’s supreme court opened an investigation into his alleged involvement in a high-speed rail contract in Saudi Arabia. He said he would assist prosecutors as required.

Hong Kong’s leader, Carrie Lam, postponed elections to the legislature that had been due in September. They will be held a year later, she said, because of covid-19. Pro-democracy candidates had been expected to do well.

America imposed sanctions on the Xinjiang Production and Construction Corps, and two Communist Party officials linked to it, for their alleged role in human-rights abuses.
